Higher level functionality described in integration specs:

* Finalization process:
  - add managing dependencies between mappers so finalize is run in correct order
  + setting up relation gateways in relation registry
  + finalizing defined mappers

* Mapper API
  - use model name to automatically set base relation name (ie. "User" => :users)
  - introduce Query API on mapper class level

* Attribute mapping:
  - PORO:
    - "direct" 1:1 mapping (when both name and type is the same)
    - mapping with custom field names
    - mapping with custom transformations (eg string on the db level but date object in ruby)
  - Virtus:
    - automatic mapper generation based on declared attributes
    - mapping of embedded values
    - mapping of embedded collections
    - mapping of value objects

* Relationship Mapping:
  + OneToOne
  + OneToMany
  + ManyToOne
  - ManyToMany

* Query API:
  - first
  - last
  - find_all
  - find
  - sort_by
  - limit
  - include

General stuff after "spike" is done:

* Setup metric tools
* Setup travis
* Add unit specs
* REFACTOR EVERYTHING ;)
