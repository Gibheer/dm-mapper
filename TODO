* Finalization process:
  - Setting up relation gateways in relation registry
  - Finalizing defined mappers

* Attribute mapping:
  - PORO:
    - "direct" 1:1 mapping (when both name and type is the same)
    - mapping with custom field names
    - mapping with custom transformations (eg string on the db level but date object in ruby)
  - Virtus:
    - automatic mapper generation based on declared attributes
    - mapping of embedded values
    - mapping of embedded collections
    - mapping of value objects

  - OneToMany
  - ManyToOne
  - ManyToMany

* Query API:
  - first
  - last
  - all
  - find

General stuff after "spike" is done:

* Setup metric tools
* Setup travis
* Add unit specs
* REFACTOR EVERYTHING ;)
